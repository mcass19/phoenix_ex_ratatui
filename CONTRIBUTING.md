# Contributing to PhoenixExRatatui

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

PhoenixExRatatui is built on [ExRatatui](https://github.com/mcass19/ex_ratatui). Feel free to also consider contributing on the upstream library if you're missing a feature, or something is not working. Contributions are welcome everywhere!

This guide will help you get set up.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mcass19/phoenix_ex_ratatui.git
cd phoenix_ex_ratatui
```

2. Prerequisites:

- **Elixir** 1.17+ and **Erlang/OTP** 26+.
- **Node.js** 22+ — only needed to rebuild the JS hook bundle. End users installing from hex don't need it.

3. Fetch dependencies:

```sh
mix deps.get
mix assets.install   # cd assets && npm install
```

## Running Tests

```sh
mix test
mix test --cover        # must report 100.00% Total
```

The suite uses `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` to drive the live widget end-to-end without a browser. It also includes property-based invariants via [`stream_data`](https://hex.pm/packages/stream_data) — proving the `Renderer.Html` cell/diff encoding round-trips losslessly through JSON across the full input space. Properties run as part of the regular `mix test` invocation.

## Bundling the JS

```sh
mix assets.build       # cd assets && npm run build (minified)
# or
cd assets && npm run build:dev   # with sourcemaps
```

The bundled output lands at `lib/assets/phoenix_ex_ratatui/main.js`. The file is committed so the published hex package needs no Node toolchain at install time.

If you change anything under `assets/js/`, rerun `mix assets.build` and commit the regenerated bundle.

The hook's pure logic (color/style/key decoding) has unit tests under `assets/test/`. Run them with `cd assets && npm test` — Node's built-in test runner, no extra deps. CI runs them on every push.

## Branching and Commits

- Branch from `main`
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use descriptive commit message prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR, make sure the following pass:

```sh
mix format --check-formatted
mix compile --warnings-as-errors
mix credo --strict
mix dialyzer
mix test --cover
```

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Add tests for new functionality
- Add `@doc`, `@spec`, and `@moduledoc` for new public functions and modules
- Update documentation (moduledocs, CHANGELOG, README if applicable)
- For breaking changes, include migration notes in the CHANGELOG
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review
